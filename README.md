# CIP SYSTEM MANAGEMENT
CENTRAL INSTITUTE OF PSYCHIATRY (A Software CIP System) 




TITLE OF THE PROJECT 
 CENTRAL INSTITUTE OF PSYCHIATRY 
(A Software of CIP System)

INTRODUCTION
There is software on CENTRAL INSTITUTE OF PSYCHIATRY (A Software CIP System) that can manages all the information such as Patients Records for OPD, Master Record, Demographic, General Psychiatric Case,Neurology Case, Epilepsy Case, Sleep Disorder Case, Headache Case,  Deaddiction Case, Emergency Clinic, Skin Clinic, Old Cases, Admission Chart, Discharge Chart, Extension Clinic, Registration Card. The software on CENTRAL INSTITUTE OF PSYCHIATRY makes the bank more informatics. Having got to know all about the basic concepts of hardware and software we will know examine how to go about using the computer to achieve our objectives of processing a job. The task is achieved through that is called system analysis and design.
OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT
•	Integration 
	The central objective of the project that each day and every component of CENTRAL INSTITUTE OF PSYCHIATRY
(A Software of CPI System) that can manages all the information such as Patients Records for OPD, Master Record, Demographic, General Psychiatric Case, Neurology Case, Epilepsy Case, Sleep Disorder Case, Headache Case,  De-Addiction Case, Emergency Clinic, Skin Clinic, Old Cases, Admission Chart, Discharge Chart, Extension Clinic, Registration Card. It means that several part of CENTRAL INSTITUTE OF PSYCHIATRY
(A Software of CPI System) work together within the system even though each part perform a unique function.
	Interaction  : Each and every component of  CENTRAL INSTITUTE OF PSYCHIATRY (A Software of CPI System)  should be interacting each other.
	Control : Manager should control whole database of the bank.
	Security : To provide good security to database of the CPI.
The main objective of our CENTRAL INSTITUTE OF PSYCHIATRY
(A Software of CPI System), it make more easiest for managing the information then manual system. Our software can perform easily query then human. The project is aimed to maintain daily activities of CENTRAL INSTITUTE OF PSYCHIATRY
(A Software of CPI System) this stores and give good security to this data. I use graphics facility of Java Swing due to which windows looks attractive to clients, for this I design different windows from where the client can interact with database. The software will also produce a report for the various details. 






Need Of the Project 
In a nutshell the software performs the following tasks/jobs : -
Patients Records for OPD
 Master Record
Demographic
General Psychiatric Case
Neurology Case
 Epilepsy Case
Sleep Disorder Case
 Headache Case
Deaddiction Case
Emergency Clinic
Skin Clinic
 Old Cases
 Admission Chart
Discharge Chart
Extension Clinic
Registration Card


The software has the following advantages : -

	Manually manageable system. 
	Our software is highly accurate as well as detectable then manual system.
	Deleting or updating the Recordse is more informatics then manual system.
	Finding the records of the Patients is more easy then manual system.
	Finding all the records as well as list of the Records available in the CPI more easily.
	Our software can maintain more and more record in a little of time and having more stores capacity.
	It is more cheapest than manual system, because our software easily handle by one or two persons but manual system is handle by more than two persons. 
	Query about the Patients / member of the system as well as Our software is easier to handle / manage than about searching the particular / specified Records as well as any type of transaction handling is easier than manual system.



INPUT TO THE PROJECT

A user is required to input : -  
	Patients Record
	Members Record
	Test Record, etc. 

 
OUTPUT OF THE PROJECT
                                      
The software will produce following output : -
Master Record
Demographic
General Psychiatric
Neurology
Epilepsy
Sleep Disorder
Headache
De-Addiction
Skin Clinic
Emergency Clinic
Extension Clinic
Old Cases
Admission
Discharge
Report
Update
Exit
 

Development  Environment 

CENTRAL INSTITUTE OF PSYCHIATRY (A Software of CIP System) has been coded in the Swing is a widget toolkit for Java. It is part of Sun Microsystems' Java Foundation Classes (JFC) — an API for providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for Java programs.
Swing was developed to provide a more sophisticated set of GUI components than the earlier Abstract Window Toolkit. Swing provides a native look and feel that emulates the look and feel of several platforms, and also supports a pluggable look and feel that allows applications to have a look and feel unrelated to the underlying platform.

TOOLS / ENVIRONMENT USED
Some of the software/Tools/Package/Platforms, which are used to run this project properly can be categorized and listed below. 
Language
Our software is coded in the Swing is a widget toolkit for Java and backend MS Access.
Environment used or operating system used
                                    This software supports : -
	Windows Operating System.




HARDWARE REQUIREMENT
The following hardware requirements are needed : -
	PENTIUM – 4  PROCESSOR.
	RAM  512  MB.
	COLOR  MONITOR.
	And  its  PERIPHERALS.

Documentation 
Word Processor  :  Microsoft Office 
2000 Graphics Package :  Microsoft Paint  
SYSTEM ANALYSIS
	

“Analysis is the study of the problem, prior to talking some action…the most important product of systems analysis…is the specification document.” ”Successful completion of the analysis phase involves all of the following:

	Selecting an optimal target.
	Producing detailed documentation of that target in such a manner that subsequent implementation can be evaluated to see whether the target has been attained.
	Producing accurate predictions of the important parameters associated with the target, including costs, schedules and performance characteristics.
	Obtaining concurrence on each of the items above from each of the affected parties.


Introduction to RDBMS


Concept of RDBMS: this part gives you details about the basic concepts like how the data is viewed in Relational Database Management System and advantage of RDBMS over other systems.

Codd’s rules: Defines the relational completeness of a DBMS.

Primary key’s: Any column or set of columns that uniquely identify rows of table.

Entity integrity: The primary key of a table should not be partially or wholly NULL.

Referential integrity: No foreign key value may reference primary key that does not exists.

Normalization: It is a technique that is logically groups the data over a number of tables, which are independent and contain no unnecessary data.

Structured Query Language (SQL): It is a high level language, set oriented, interactive data database language for RDBMS. Used for definition and manipulation of database objects.




    Rules for RDBMS (codd’s rule)

Rule 1: Representation of information

	All data must be represented logically in tables.

Rule 2: Guaranteed logical accessibility

	All data is accessible logically using a combination of table name, key name, key value and column.

Rule 3: Null support

	Null value support missing information and are not to be confused with empty, blank or zero filled data. They also are not necessarily equal.

Rule 4: Dynamic online catalog

	The definition of data is represented in the same manner as data so that it can be relationally accessed. Example every database has catalog tables.

Rule 5: Comprehensive data sub-language (high level language like SQL)

	A unique language, which is supported along with several other programming languages to achieve data definition, view and manipulation.

Rule 6: Updateable views

	All views that can theoretically exist can be updated.

Rule 7: High-level insert, update and delete

	Both base and derived relation can be handled as singular request and apply to retrieval, insert, update and deletion of data.

Rule 8: Physical data independence

	Program and terminal activities are preserved when changes are made in storage representation or access method.

Rule 9: Logical data independence

	Program and terminal activities are preserved when changes are made to base tables.


Rule 10: Integrity independence

	Integrity constraints must be definable in the unique sub-language and sorted in the catalog.

Rule 11: Distribution independence

	The unique sub-language must support database distribution while preserving program and terminal activities.

Rule 12: Non-subversion

	A relational system, which performs low-level processing of records, cannot supplant the integrity rules in effect in high level, record processing by a relational language.
